# Sonify

Main idea for this project is to build a small project within a Jupyter Notebook to sonify examples of Atomic Hydrogen spectrum - for an individual galaxy and for a galaxy group - and here it is :)

For sonification we are using Python package: [Astronify](https://astronify.readthedocs.io/en/latest/astronify/index.html#)

Data: g1, g2, g3, g4 and g5

Entire project is within Jupyter Notebook: `Sonify_Atomic_Hydrogen_in_Galaxies.ipynb`

The project overview is available on this [webpage](https://rdzudzar.github.io/sonify.html)
