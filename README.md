# Sonify

Main idea for this project is to build a small project within a Jupyter Notebook to sonify examples of Atomic Hydrogen spectrum - for an individual galaxy and for a galaxy group - and here it is :)

For sonification we are using Python package: [Astronify](https://astronify.readthedocs.io/en/latest/astronify/index.html#)
